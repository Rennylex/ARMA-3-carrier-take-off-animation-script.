# ARMA-3-script-for-carrier-take-off-animation
**** PBOmanager required.

If you want to check out the code, PBOmanager, which can be downloaded via ARMA3 Tools, is required.

Just put this .pbo file in the folder named 'MPmissions' in the Arma3 folder.

This is not a Mission script, it just contains the scripts of the animations sequence.


*****Thanks to Nikoaton, Xnooz and Direone, their animations make all these possible.
