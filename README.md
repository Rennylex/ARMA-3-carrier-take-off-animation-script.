# ARMA-3-script-for-carrier-take-off-animation
This repository includes the scripts i wrote for a Multiplayer Mission in ARMA 3. **** PBOmanager required.

If you want to check out the code, PBOmanager which can be downloaded via ARMA3 Tools is required.

Just put this .pbo file in the folder named 'MPmissions' in the Arma3 folder.
